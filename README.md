In this screenshot, you can see our main character, Drago, along with dynamic UI elements. 
The life bar is uniquely represented by eggs, and there's also a life counter and an egg tracker. 
These elements not only add to the game's aesthetic but also provide real-time feedback to the player.

This screenshot showcases the collectable items scattered throughout the game environment. 
These items were developed in Unity and coded using C#. 
The inclusion of collectables was a group decision, highlighting our team's collaborative spirit and diversity.

## Screenshot 3: Boss Enemy and Scenery Change

Here, you'll notice a significant change in the scenery, setting the stage for the boss enemy encounter. 
This layout was designed to differentiate the boss level from the rest of the game, adding an extra layer of excitement and challenge.

### Project Summary:
This was a short-term project consisting of only two levels, but it was an intensive learning experience. It provided me with a comprehensive understanding of game components and dynamics, serving as a valuable stepping stone in my journey into game development.
